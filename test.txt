The fall, which equates3 to about seven points per generation, is believed to have begun with those born in 1975, according to the first authoritative4 study of the phenomenon.

The drop in scores marks the end of a trend – known as the Flynn effect – which has seen average IQs rise for the past 60 to 70 years by roughly three points a decade.

Scientists have described the results as 'impressive' but 'pretty worrying', according to the Times.

The decline is to do with a difference in the way languages and maths are taught in schools, scientists have suggested.

However, it could also be down to people spending more time on technological5 devices instead of reading books.

Stuart Ritchie, a psychologist at the University of Edinburgh who did not take part in the research, told the newspaper: 'This is the most convincing evidence yet of a reversal of the Flynn Effect.

'If you assume their model is correct, the results are impressive, and pretty worrying.'
